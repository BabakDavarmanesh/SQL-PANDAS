# Big Countries SQL Challenge

This repository contains an SQL solution to the **Big Countries** problem.  
The task is based on the `World` table, which provides details about countries such as their area, population, continent, and GDP.  

---

## Problem Statement

We are given the following table:

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                      |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| name        | varchar | Primary key; unique name of the country           |
| continent   | varchar | Continent where the country is located           |
| area        | int     | Area of the country in square kilometers         |
| population  | int     | Population of the country                        |
| gdp         | bigint  | GDP of the country                               |

Each row represents information about a country.  

A **country is considered big if**:
- Its area is **at least 3,000,000 kmÂ²**, OR  
- Its population is **at least 25,000,000**.  

We need to return the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the **big countries**.
